## 💡 Example Stories

**Janitor** + **Spooky** tone:
> "I've been cleaning this office building for three years, and I thought I knew every corner. But last Tuesday, while mopping the third floor, I noticed something odd. The elevator button for the fourth floor was glowing, even though this building only has three floors..."

**Barista** + **Wholesome** tone:
> "She came in every morning at 7:23 AM, ordered the same thing—medium coffee, two sugars, no cream. Never said much beyond 'thank you.' Then one day, she left a note with her payment: 'Your smile got me through the worst year of my life. Thank you for being kind to a stranger.'"
